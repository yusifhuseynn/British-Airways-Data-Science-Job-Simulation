# British Airways - Data Science Job Simulation

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook and supporting files for the British Airways Data Science Virtual Experience Program, completed on the Forage platform. The project simulates a real-world data science task performed by the British Airways analytics team.

## Project Overview

During this simulation, I performed exploratory data analysis and built a predictive model using customer booking data to uncover behavioral trends and key factors influencing purchase decisions. The process included:

- Data cleaning and feature engineering
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with statistical summaries and visualizations
- Development and evaluation of machine learning models to predict booking completion
- Interpretation of results and identification of the most important contributing variables
- Presentation of insights in a professional format, simulating business communication

## Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis and modeling
- Git and GitHub for version control and project sharing

## Skills Gained

This experience enhanced my technical capabilities in data analysis, predictive modeling, and data visualization, as well as my ability to communicate complex findings effectively to business stakeholders. It also deepened my interest in leveraging data to drive strategic decision-making in the aviation industry and beyond.
